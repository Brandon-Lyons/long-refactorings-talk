---

## long refactorings are simply refactorings
### only, (IN HINDSIGHT) they end up taking a lot longer than most refactorings

---

### Stepping back for a second...
## What *is* "refactoring"?

---

## Refactoring...

<br/>

### **"behavior-preserving changes to the implementation of a system"**

## **"behavior-preserving changes to the implementation of a system"**

<br/>

### This is really only true for the smallest of refactorings.

<br/>
<br/>

### In larger-scale refactorings we're typically chaining together a series of behavior-preserving changes, interspersed with behavior changes.

<br/>

### The important things are to always know which is which, and to do them intentionally.

## why do we refactor?

### **wankery**

### Again, limited time and resources,

## most refactorings are small or trivial

<br/>

### There's really no estimation involved:
### look at the code, start making the changes.

<br/>

### We're using techniques in Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_ book.

<br/>

### The refactorings are a commit or few,
### inside the boundary of a larger pull request,
### dedicated to a feature or a bugfix.

---

![](images/tonka-truck.jpg)

## many refactorings are a bit larger

<br />

### Suitable for a pair of programmers working on an afternoon,
### we can estimate them fairly accurately or do without estimation.

<br />
### We can use simple tools and processes, like feature branches, pair programming, a second or third Pull Request.

<br />

### We start to use more advanced techniques.

---

![](images/working-effectively.jpg)

## We start to draw on these techniques

<br/>

### characterization testing, refactoring to tests, sensing variables, etc.

## We eventually encounter refactorings that we know are projects

<br/>

### These refactorings are non-trivial and perhaps not even possible.
### Even the process of estimation is difficult.

---

![](images/road-block.jpg)

<br/>

### We only consider them because they are roadblocks to important features, or there are real quality problems in this part of the system, and piecemeal attempts at bugfixing fail to eliminate problems.

---

### Developers who go into these areas come back angry and muttering, they turn to the solace of drink.

<br/>


## Start with exploration

<br/>

### Do throw-away experimental refactorings of a smaller scope just to see if a large refactoring might be possible.

---

![](images/mikado.jpg)

<br/>

### use techniques like those from _The Mikado Method_ to even explore the possible refactorings

---

![](images/mikado-graph.png)

 1. Start with a goal
 2. Do the first small refactoring along the way
 3. See what breaks -- write down a graph node
 4. Repeat until no more dependencies

## A Long Refactoring Kicks Off

### Ongoing quality problems in an important part of the system
### Repeated bugfixing did not improve quality significantly
### High level feature changes roadblocked by this core subsystem

    - I spent about 5 months working on the system and looking for the points of pain -- the places where bugs were prevalent, code quality was low, and the difficulty of working on the system

    # permissions bug issues

    - Over the course of working on bugs in a number of places, it became clear that our permissioning system was bit-rotting
      - leaky behavior - still see cached notifications or stars or mentions or, etc., on repositories you no longer had access to
      - dashboards showing weird results, job queue jobs failing, help tickets related to permissions, etc.
      - poor performance on some queries, slowing the system down
      - developers not being able to reliably fix things in this area, not having a strategy on how to fix things
    - began to dig in and map out things, try candidate small refactorings on certain areas, floating larger refactoring projects to get things under control

    - more links to PRs
      - then defunkt had long-range ideas about how organizations, etc., could be reworked (only some of which have landed so far) (link parts of his discussion)
    - that catalyzed a Big Project -- "Orgs Next" -- a business-level feature that is roadblocked by our permissioning system
    - we coalesced a team, really two teams -- a front-end user-facing team, and a back-end team working on removing the roadblocks to get there
    - Capabilities
    - Abilities
    - Science
    - Backscatter
    - parallel permissioning systems running
    - repository networks
    - data quality and cleanup
    - transitions, throttling
    - making everything available for enterprise
    - organization front-end changes without abilities (anti-corruption layers, etc.)
    - making abilities be the source of truth for reads on teams and orgs
    - making abilities be the source of truth for repositories
    - removing science: no longer traversing old permission query paths
    - eventual removal of update paths for old queries
    - enterprise systems running transitions, data quality scripts
- rails3
  - ongoing (2011 -> now)
  - backporting strategy; overwhelmed by code changes; long branch
  - guard-based strategy to backport all version changes to master
  - aggressive graphing and logging
  - staying out of the way of enterprise branch points
  - reworking our script/* directory and configuration to allow toggling rails versions easily
- smoke -> gitrpc
  - just completed, 2011 -> now
  - piecewise replacement of one git layer with another
  - graph instrumentation, exception tracking, extensive use of backscatter
  - gradual increase in callers of gitrpc -- 20%, 40%, 50%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, .... 100%

 -> TODO: put the d3-type stuff here.

 -> something about team dynamics
 -> commitment to engineering over marketing, e.g.

 - need something conclusory...

 - abilities talk
    - talk about transitions, transitions with migrations (also, for enterprise); even using dynamic primary->replica lag time to adjust transition rates
    - talk about data quality scripts
    - check skitch history on old laptop's skitch install
  - do something with data (d3)
    - also, can we get labels for the different sources of data?
    - we can do a linkage graph
    - some sort of stacked graph of contributions, etc.
