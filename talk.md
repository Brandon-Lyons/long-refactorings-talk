## long refactorings
<br/>

---

## long refactorings are simply refactorings
### only, (IN HINDSIGHT) they end up taking a lot longer than most refactorings

---

### Stepping back for a second...
## What *is* "refactoring"?

---

## Refactoring...

<br/>

### **"behavior-preserving changes to the implementation of a system"**

## **"behavior-preserving changes to the implementation of a system"**

<br/>

### This is really only true for the smallest of refactorings.

<br/>
<br/>

### In larger-scale refactorings we're typically chaining together a series of behavior-preserving changes, interspersed with behavior changes.

<br/>

### The important things are to always know which is which, and to do them intentionally.

---

## why do we refactor?

### **wankery**

## refactoring a toy system

### The value is in building something useful

<br/>

### Even here, though, we have finite time and resources
### So we choose what to work on

## refactoring a system that people are actively using

---

![](images/india-bus.jpg)

### Again, limited time and resources,
### so we must make choices about what to work on,
### because the time spent on one thing cannot be spent on another.

## most refactorings are small or trivial

<br/>

### There's really no estimation involved:
### look at the code, start making the changes.

<br/>

### We're using techniques in Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_ book.

<br/>

### The refactorings are a commit or few,
### inside the boundary of a larger pull request,
### dedicated to a feature or a bugfix.

---

![](images/tonka-truck.jpg)

## many refactorings are a bit larger

<br />

### Suitable for a pair of programmers working on an afternoon,
### we can estimate them fairly accurately or do without estimation.

<br />
### We can use simple tools and processes, like feature branches, pair programming, a second or third Pull Request.

<br />

### We start to use more advanced techniques.

---

![](images/working-effectively.jpg)

## We start to draw on these techniques

<br/>

### characterization testing, refactoring to tests, sensing variables, etc.

## We eventually encounter refactorings that we know are projects

<br/>

### These refactorings are non-trivial and perhaps not even possible.
### Even the process of estimation is difficult.

---

![](images/road-block.jpg)

<br/>

### We only consider them because they are roadblocks to important features, or there are real quality problems in this part of the system, and piecemeal attempts at bugfixing fail to eliminate problems.

---

### Developers who go into these areas come back angry and muttering, they turn to the solace of drink.

## Good people are reduced to bad things.

## Tackling these ugly jobs is what we're here to talk about.

## So how do we tackle these huge refactorings?

## There are enough risks that success is unlikely

### So, aim to minimize costs.

### Aim to never be a roadblock.

## There are enough risks that success is unlikely

<br/>

### Avoid building the Second Systemâ„¢ -- the promised land of endless biscuits and gravy.

## There are enough risks that success is unlikely

### Integrate constantly.  Long-running branches are kryptonite.

## Start with exploration

<br/>

### Various people in ones and twos take stabs at feasibility over the course of months or years.

<br/>


## Start with exploration

<br/>

### Do throw-away experimental refactorings of a smaller scope just to see if a large refactoring might be possible.

---

![](images/mikado.jpg)

<br/>

### use techniques like those from _The Mikado Method_ to even explore the possible refactorings

---

![](images/mikado-graph.png)

 1. Start with a goal
 2. Do the first small refactoring along the way
 3. See what breaks -- write down a graph node
 4. Repeat until no more dependencies

## A Long Refactoring Kicks Off

### Ongoing quality problems in an important part of the system
### Repeated bugfixing did not improve quality significantly
### High level feature changes roadblocked by this core subsystem

---

![](images/abilities-team.png)

![](images/orgs-team.png)

---

## The Abilities project:

<br/>

### 4 primary developers
### 795 Pull Requests and Issues from November 2012 until August 2014

<br/>

### Multiple iterations of complete new permissioning systems
### Tight collaboration with ongoing Organization improvements

---

## (let's look at those issues)

---

---

![](images/capabilities.png)

**November 2012**

---

![](images/capabilities-1.png)

### Capabilities lived as a new permissions system, side-by-side with existing permissions until August, 2013

---

![](images/recaps.png)

### Until Abilities came onto the scene.

### Extensive performance testing led us to remodel capabilities so that granting operations were more performant

---

## How did we know?

---

![](images/scientist.jpg)

---

![](images/dat-science.png)

---

![](images/dat-science-perf.png)

### We built tools to let us (and anyone) run two code paths side-by-side.
### Then performance data is published by instrumentation into our graphite cluster.

---

![](images/adminable-by-science.png)

---

## Don't Roadblock

<br/>

### Long-running branches are kryptonite.
### We can land short-lived branches to "dark ship" new code.
### With science and instrumentation tools we can gather real production measurements in a controlled fashion.

---

## The project will ebb and flow

<br/>

### Always have enough side project work available that you can stay fresh and not get bogged down.
### People will come and go (and often return) on a truly long refactoring.
### You will be at an impasse many times.
### Rely on your team, and allow yourself to experiment with crazy things.
### Your creativity is an asset.


---

![](images/backscatter.png)

### Sometimes it's just hard to figure out if the code you are changing is even being used. Try to be 100% safe.

---


![](images/backscatter-1.png)

---

![](images/backscatter-2.png)

### Just a glorified wrapper around ruby's `caller` method.

---

![](images/nil-can.png)

### ... which can be put to holy or horrible uses.
---

![](images/horrible-people.png)

### Because, really, we're all such horrible people.

---

## Staying alive

<br/>

### Keep your sense of humor.
### Rely on your peoples.
### Keep close.
### Take a vacation.  This is a marathon.
### You actually can leave and do something else.
### Work-life balance is important.

    - Backscatter
    - parallel permissioning systems running
    - repository networks
    - data quality and cleanup
    - transitions, throttling
    - making everything available for enterprise
    - organization front-end changes without abilities (anti-corruption layers, etc.)
    - making abilities be the source of truth for reads on teams and orgs
    - making abilities be the source of truth for repositories
    - removing science: no longer traversing old permission query paths
    - eventual removal of update paths for old queries
    - enterprise systems running transitions, data quality scripts
- rails3
  - ongoing (2011 -> now)
  - backporting strategy; overwhelmed by code changes; long branch
  - guard-based strategy to backport all version changes to master
  - aggressive graphing and logging
  - staying out of the way of enterprise branch points
  - reworking our script/* directory and configuration to allow toggling rails versions easily
- smoke -> gitrpc
  - just completed, 2011 -> now
  - piecewise replacement of one git layer with another
  - graph instrumentation, exception tracking, extensive use of backscatter
  - gradual increase in callers of gitrpc -- 20%, 40%, 50%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, .... 100%

 -> TODO: put the d3-type stuff here.

 -> something about team dynamics
 -> commitment to engineering over marketing, e.g.

 - need something conclusory...

 - abilities talk
    - talk about transitions, transitions with migrations (also, for enterprise); even using dynamic primary->replica lag time to adjust transition rates
    - talk about data quality scripts
    - check skitch history on old laptop's skitch install
  - do something with data (d3)
    - also, can we get labels for the different sources of data?
    - we can do a linkage graph
    - some sort of stacked graph of contributions, etc.
